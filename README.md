# FastScape Demo

Some [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks showing how to build,
customize and run a landscape evolution model (FastScape) using the
xarray-simlab modelling framework.

## How to run the notebooks?

You can try running the notebooks from your browser without installing
anything thanks to [binder](https://mybinder.org/). Just click on the
"launch binder" badge above to launch a new notebook server.

Alternatively, you can run the notebook server on your own
machine. Assuming that you have `git` and
[conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) installed, you just need to
run the following commands to install and activate the environment:

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscape-demo
   $ cd fastscape-demo
   $ conda env create -f environment.yml
   $ source activate fastscape-demo
```

Note that on windows platforms, the last command is simply `activate
fastscape-demo`. For recent conda versions (4.4+), you can use
`conda activate fastscape-demo`.

Then run the command below to start the notebook server. It should open
a new tab in your browser.

```
    $ jupyter notebook
```
