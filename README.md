# FastScape Demo

This repository contains a collection of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
notebooks with examples of using the Fastscape software stack for landscape
evolution modeling and topographic analysis.

More information on this website: https://fastscape.org

## How to run the notebooks?

### Run in the cloud (Binder)

You can run the notebooks in your browser without installing anything thanks to
[binder](https://mybinder.org/). Just follow the link below or click on the
"launch binder" badge above and it will launch remotely a new notebook server
for you:

[Run on binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fastscape-lem/fastscape-demo/master?urlpath=lab)

This service is for demo purpose only, do not rely on it for doing more serious
work.

### Install and run locally (Docker)

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images are built automatically for this
repository. Those images provide the whole computing environment (pre-installed
and pre-configured) needed to run the notebooks. The only requirement is to
have Docker installed on your machine (it is available on all platforms
Linux/Windows/Mac and it can be installed from the Docker website or using one
of your platform's package managers).

Run the command below first to pull the latest image:

```bash
$ docker pull fastscape/fastscape-demo:latest
```

Then run the command below to start the Jupyterlab application from the Docker
container (replace `test-fastscape` if you want to give another name to your
local container):

```bash
$ docker run -it --name test-fastscape -p 8888:8888 fastscape/fastscape-demo jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0
```

Check [Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for additional run
options, e.g., if you want to use the Jupyterlab application with notebooks or
files on your local filesystem (i.e., not in the container).

You can then enter the url and token provided in your browser to start using the
application. When you are done you need to stop (and optionally remove) the container:

``` bash
$ docker stop test-fastscape
$ docker rm test-fastscape
```

### Install and run locally (Conda)

Assuming that you have `git` and [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html)
installed, you can install all the packages required to run the notebooks in a
new conda environment using the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscape-demo
$ cd fastscape-demo
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate fastscape-demo
```

You also need to install a few Jupyterlab extensions with the following command
(this step won't be required anymore with Jupyterlab >= 3.x):

```bash
$ jupyter labextension install \
    @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager \
    @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz \
    dask-labextension \
    ipygany
```

You can finally run the command below to start the Jupyterlab application. It
should open a new tab in your browser.

```bash
$ jupyter lab
```
